# Air-Friction-Simulation
This is a simulation about air friction. If you wish there is a more detailed description in the form of a video on my youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/@Gilbertsonium
This simulation predicts the y velocity of a falling object given an area drag coefficient and some other constants. For a more comprensive explanation wath my video on air friction.
